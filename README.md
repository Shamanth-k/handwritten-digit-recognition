## 1\. About the Project

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits (0-9). It uses the famous MNIST dataset, which is a benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision. The goal is to build a robust model that can accurately classify handwritten digits from images.

This project serves as an excellent starting point for beginners in Deep Learning and Computer Vision, demonstrating the fundamental steps of data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 2\. Features

  * **Data Loading & Visualization:** Efficiently loads and displays samples from the MNIST dataset.
  * **Data Preprocessing:** Normalizes pixel values and reshapes images for CNN input. Labels are one-hot encoded.
  * **CNN Model:** Implements a simple yet effective CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras for image classification.
  * **Model Training:** Trains the CNN on the preprocessed MNIST training data.
  * **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluates the model's accuracy and loss on unseen test data.
  * **Prediction Examples:** Demonstrates how to use the trained model to predict digits on new images.

## 3\. Dataset

The project utilizes the **MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset**.

  * **Contents:** A large database of handwritten digits.
  * **Images:** Consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
  * **Format:** Each image is a $28 \\times 28$ pixel grayscale image.
  * **Labels:** Each image is associated with a label indicating the digit it represents (0-9).

The MNIST dataset is conveniently available directly through `tf.keras.datasets.mnist`.

## 4\. Model Architecture

The CNN model built for this project consists of the following layers:

1.  **Convolutional Layer 1 (`Conv2D`):**
      * 32 filters, $3 \\times 3$ kernel size.
      * `relu` activation.
      * `input_shape=(28, 28, 1)` for grayscale images.
2.  **Max Pooling Layer 1 (`MaxPooling2D`):**
      * $2 \\times 2$ pool size.
3.  **Convolutional Layer 2 (`Conv2D`):**
      * 64 filters, $3 \\times 3$ kernel size.
      * `relu` activation.
4.  **Max Pooling Layer 2 (`MaxPooling2D`):**
      * $2 \\times 2$ pool size.
5.  **Flatten Layer (`Flatten`):**
      * Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
6.  **Dense Layer 1 (`Dense`):**
      * 128 neurons.
      * `relu` activation.
7.  **Dropout Layer (`Dropout`):**
      * Drops 50% of neurons to prevent overfitting.
8.  **Output Layer (`Dense`):**
      * 10 neurons (one for each digit 0-9).
      * `softmax` activation for probability distribution over classes.

The model is compiled with the `adam` optimizer and `categorical_crossentropy` loss function, tracking `accuracy` as a metric.

## 5\. Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine or in Google Colab.

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.x
  * Git (for cloning the repository locally)

### Installation

If running locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition.git
    cd Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
    ```

    (Replace `YourUsername` with your actual GitHub username and `Handwritten-Digit-Recognition` with your repository name if different.)

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(If `requirements.txt` is not present, create it using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing the necessary libraries manually: `pip install tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn numpy`)*

### Running the Notebook

  * **Locally (Jupyter Notebook/Lab):**

    1.  Ensure you have Jupyter installed (`pip install jupyter`).
    2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
    3.  Run: `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`
    4.  Open `Handwritten_Digit_Recognition.ipynb` in your browser.

  * **Google Colab (Recommended):**

    1.  Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
    2.  Click on `File` -\> `Open notebook`.
    3.  Go to the `GitHub` tab.
    4.  Enter your repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/YourUsername/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition`) and press Enter.
    5.  Select `Handwritten_Digit_Recognition.ipynb` to open it.
    6.  The environment is pre-configured with TensorFlow, so you can run the cells directly\!

## 6\. Usage

Once the notebook is open (either locally or in Colab), simply run each cell sequentially from top to bottom.

The notebook will:

1.  Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
2.  Define and compile the CNN model.
3.  Train the model for a specified number of epochs.
4.  Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
5.  Display plots of training history (accuracy and loss).
6.  Show predictions for a few sample images from the test set.

## 7\. Results

After training for a few epochs (e.g., 10-15), the model typically achieves **\~98-99% accuracy** on the MNIST test dataset. The plots generated after training will visualize the model's accuracy and loss over epochs for both training and validation sets, helping to identify potential overfitting or underfitting.

## 8\. Code Explanation

The notebook is structured into clear sections:

  * **Import Libraries:** Imports `tensorflow`, `keras`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`.
  * **Load Data:** Downloads and loads the MNIST dataset.
  * **Explore Data:** Prints shapes and displays sample images.
  * **Preprocess Data:**
      * Normalizes pixel values by dividing by 255.
      * Reshapes image data to add a channel dimension (`(batch, height, width, channels)`).
      * One-hot encodes the labels (e.g., 5 becomes `[0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]`).
  * **Build Model:** Defines the Sequential CNN model architecture.
  * **Compile Model:** Configures the model for training (optimizer, loss, metrics).
  * **Train Model:** Fits the model to the training data.
  * **Evaluate Model:** Assesses performance on the test data and plots training history.
  * **Make Predictions:** Shows how to get predictions for individual images.

Each significant block of code has comments explaining its purpose.

## 9\. Future Enhancements

  * **Data Augmentation:** Implement techniques like rotation, shifting, and zooming to artificially expand the training dataset and improve generalization.
  * **More Complex Architectures:** Experiment with deeper CNNs (e.g., VGG, ResNet-like blocks) or different activation functions.
  * **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to systematically find optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of filters, dropout rate).
  * **Model Saving/Loading:** Add code to save the trained model and load it later for inference without retraining.
  * **TensorBoard Integration:** Use TensorBoard for advanced visualization of training metrics, model graphs, and more.
  * **Deployment:** Explore deploying the model as a web service (e.g., with Flask/FastAPI) or a simple desktop application.
